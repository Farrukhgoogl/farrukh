Contributing Guidelines
We love pull requests from everyone! Bug reports are also welcome.

However if you've got a question or would like to start a discussion, please post to Bitcoin stack exchange or the G+ community.

If you would like to contribute language translations, we prefer if you use our Transifex project. Languages will be synced from there regularly.
